  After several years of hosting free monthly “Strategy Meetups” on Zoom for
  Causey software clients, we’ve decided to discontinue these sessions due to
  low attendance. Moving forward, we’re focusing on offering individualized
  support and enhancing our free or low cost online resources. Here's more
  information.

As you may know, each month for the last few years we’ve offered a free one-hour “Strategy Meetup” over Zoom for our Causey software clients to connect with our consultants and address strategic questions. We've enjoyed these sessions—hearing your challenges, sharing insights, and building relationships with you.

After much reflection, we've decided to discontinue these sessions. The sessions were sparsely attended, with no clients showing up for around half of the sessions. Further, we believe we can provide even better support in other ways.

Going forward, you can reach out to us for individual support as follows:

- Causey-related Technical Questions and Support: email [help@causey.app](mailto:help@causey.app)
- Strategic planning-related Questions and Support: email or call your consultant or email [admin@missionmet.com](mailto:admin@missionmet.com) to get connected with a consultant

In addition, we plan on strengthening our suite of free or low cost resources for you on our [Causey](https://www.causey.app) website.

**Thank You!**

Thanks to everyone who joined us during a meetup. We will continue to be here to help your organization achieve its strategic goals in impactful ways. Drop us a line if you have a question—we’d love to hear from you!

**Onward into 2025**
