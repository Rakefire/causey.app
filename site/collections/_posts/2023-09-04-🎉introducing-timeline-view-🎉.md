We're excited to provide you with a significant new feature in Mission Met Center that will help make your work more productive: Timeline View. This view of your plan allows you to quickly see all of your goals within a specific time frame on a timeline.

Access this view by selecting the Timeline View tab at the top of your plan in the Strategy application.

You'll be taken to a timeline that shows the estimated completion time frame for your goals based on your selected start and due dates. It's a great visual representation of the time it will take to complete your goals.&nbsp;

Your feedback helped us develop this feature and we hope you find it a helpful tool in laying out your plan.
