Today, we made a significant change in our business by rebranding Mission Met Center to Causey –&nbsp; a standalone, strategic planning software that can serve any mission-driven team regardless of method, experience level, or relationship with Mission Met.

As part of this change, we will be implementing new pricing tiers for the first time since launching in 2015. The change in pricing is intended to better align our business with the success of our customers.

## **We're changing our pricing**

## **Here's why**

We love working side by side with our customers, mission-driven leaders like you. The interest and growth we’re seeing in customers who are looking for more advanced features, or who just need the software and not consulting through Mission Met, has driven this decision.&nbsp;

We want our customers to have options when it comes to working with Mission Met. This change in pricing allows us to build our software and our team in a way that provides all customers with the tools they need to advance their mission through their strategic planning efforts.&nbsp;

These changes are intended to make our customers more successful by maintaining current features of our software and developing new and exciting features.

## **No impact on existing customers until August 31,&nbsp; 2023**

We are incredibly grateful to our customers. We love helping you advance your mission and partner with you on your strategic plan. We know that summer is a time of reflection before many dive into strategies for the fall season. We also want to provide you time to get in touch with us if you have questions.&nbsp; That's why we don’t want pricing to change until August 31.

### **For existing customers:**

* You will continue to pay your current rate until August 31, 2023.
* Since we are switching to three tiers for pricing, you will be notified of the selected tier you’ll be placed in by our team that most closely matches your current plan and needs.
* If you want to change the tier that has been selected for you, you can up until August 31. After that date, you will be billed at the updated rates based on your selection (monthly or annually). Instructions on how to change your tier can be found [here](https://help.missionmet.com/articles/172-change-pricing-tier?auth=true&amp;preview=649353d8c371d73187fa3b95){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.
* You can always change your tier based on your billing cycle (monthly or annually).
* You will retain all features in the software as you are currently using them (for example, if you have more metrics than your tier allows, you will retain the amount you currently have.)

## **Our commitment**

With everything we do, we take the time to consider the impact our decisions will have on our customers and our team. This decision has been made after a lot of thought, reflection, and review.&nbsp;

We hope you have experienced value with Mission Met Center and will continue to trust Causey with your strategic planning needs.&nbsp; We are committed to continuing to add value to the product to justify this change.

This begins today with the announcement of two new features – tags and super focus mode.

We’ve expanded focus mode for core and solid tier subscribers. Focus mode for lite subscribers allows users to populate the actions of the plan for items that are only assigned to them. When super focus mode is on, users have the ability to populate the actions section by any person on your team, by tag and by progress update status. Super focus mode is available in both the Strategy and Metrics apps.

Additionally, core and solid subscribers can create and add tags to most aspects of their plan. This makes your content easily searchable using filters and can help you find information across your plan that relates to a specific topic.

## **Product improvements on the horizon**

We are also putting plans in place for future feature introductions and improvements.

* Folders within documents&nbsp;
* Ability to customize icons
* Asana integration
* Customize sending schedules and gain control of when emails are sent
* Advanced reporting
* API Access for metrics and measurements, plans, etc.
