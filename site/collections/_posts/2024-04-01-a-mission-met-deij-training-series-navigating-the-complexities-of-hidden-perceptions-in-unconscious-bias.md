Mission Met introduces our workshop focused on understanding and addressing unconscious bias within the organization. This training is part of [Mission Met's broader DEIJ efforts](https://www.missionmet.com/deij){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, which are designed to foster a more inclusive, fair, and just organizational culture. By addressing unconscious bias, we hope to create a workplace where all individuals feel valued and respected.

In this session, our team explored how unconscious biases—those hidden and often unrecognized perceptions—can influence decision-making, interactions, and overall organizational culture. The workshop aimed to raise awareness among team members about the existence of these biases and their potential impact on creating an inclusive and equitable work environment.

Key takeaways from the session include the importance of self-awareness and education in identifying and mitigating unconscious biases. The team discussed practical strategies to counteract these biases, such as actively seeking diverse perspectives, questioning assumptions, and implementing structured decision-making processes that minimize the influence of bias.
