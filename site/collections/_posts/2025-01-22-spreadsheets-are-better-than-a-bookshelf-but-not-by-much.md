We’ve all seen it: that shiny new strategic plan sitting on the shelf, collecting dust. You know the one—the plan that everyone was excited about when it was created but somehow never gets executed. It's easy to get caught up in the excitement of planning, but without the right tools, even the best strategy can end up gathering cobwebs.

We use spreadsheets and documents for collaboration just like your organization. Sure, they work for the basics, but when it comes to strategic planning, they just don’t cut it. My guess is you also have a strategy tracking spreadsheet taking up storage space on your computer, just like a strategic plan on a bookshelf.

That’s why we created [Causey](http://causey.app)—a strategic planning platform built for nonprofits. Spreadsheets and other generic tools just aren’t built for strategic planning. Causey is! It’s packed with features designed to not only help you create a plan but also make sure you actually execute it like a pro. Keep reading to find out how Causey can take your strategic planning from meh to marvelous.
