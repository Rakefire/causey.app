Mission Met’s ongoing effort to incorporate Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Justice (DEIJ) into our organizational culture includes internal workshops in which team members explore topics related to DEIJ that resonate with them personally. These workshops are meant to inform the team while fostering a deeper understanding and commitment to our [DEIJ principles](https://www.missionmet.com/deij){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. Our latest workshop centered on the topic of allyship against racism.

The training provided an opportunity for the team to explore the concept of allyship, particularly in the context of combating racism. The session emphasized the importance of understanding one's role as an ally and the need for continuous self-education and action to support marginalized communities effectively. The discussion included strategies for being a more active ally, such as speaking out against racism, supporting anti-racist policies, and fostering an inclusive environment in the workplace.

The blog also touches on the personal reflections of team members, who shared their experiences and insights on how they can contribute to creating a more equitable and just society. The goal of the workshop was to inspire ongoing commitment to DEIJ principles and to ensure that allyship against racism is not just a one-time effort but a sustained practice.
