You may have noticed some enhancements to Mission Met Center that can help you track, measure, and implement your strategic plan. Here is a round-up of some of the newest features:

## **Calendar Feed**

Want to sync your Google or iCal calendars with your plan's goal and action item deadlines? We have two options for you. Opt to subscribe to your organization's calendar (which will sync all goals and action items for your organization) and your individual calendar (which will sync only the goals and action items assigned to you.)&nbsp;

## **Action Items: Progress Tracker**

We've added the popular goal progress tracker to action items! Now when you add or edit an action item, you can track the progress toward completion with the % slider and note if the task is completed or not with the status checkbox.

**Weekly Look-ahead Email**

To keep you on track, we'll send you an email every Monday that will list your goals and action items that you've completed recently, and any goals and action items that are due soon (or past due). You're automatically registered to receive this email. Set your notification preferences on your account page.
