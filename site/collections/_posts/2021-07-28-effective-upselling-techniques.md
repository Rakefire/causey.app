  Upselling is a sales technique whereby a seller induces the customer to
  purchase more expensive items, upgrades or other add-ons in an attempt to make
  a more profitable sale. While it usually involves marketing more profitable
  services or   products, it can be simply exposing the customer to other
  options that were perhaps not considered.

Upselling is a sales technique whereby a seller induces the customer to purchase more expensive items, upgrades or other add-ons in an attempt to make a more profitable sale.

In practice, large businesses usually combine upselling and cross-selling to maximize profit. In doing so, an organization must ensure that its relationship with the client is not disrupted.
