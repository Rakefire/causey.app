Strategic partnerships enable nonprofits to pool strengths, resources, and expertise to tackle complex social issues and achieve greater collective success, driving lasting positive change.

Check out [Mission Met’s blog about specific barriers to partnerships](https://www.missionmet.com/blog/overcoming-barriers-to-nonprofit-partnerships-building-strong-collaborations-for-social-impact) that we hear about from mission-driven leaders, including limited resources, communication issues, and inadequate planning. The article also offers suggestions for how to overcome each barrier.

We’d like to offer a suggestion of our own to help partnerships succeed — use technology tools where you can. Causey can help you define the Mission, Vision, and Values of a partnership, as well as define your goals and track progress. Having one consistent place to provide updates will help the partnership teams communicate efficiently and effectively.

Overcoming barriers to nonprofit partnerships requires commitment, communication, and collaboration.&nbsp;
