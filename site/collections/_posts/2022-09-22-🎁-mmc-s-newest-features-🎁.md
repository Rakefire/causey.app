We‚Äôve added some cool new functionality to Mission Met Center over the last few months. Read on for quick summaries and check them out in MMC for yourself.&nbsp;

### **Presentation View**

#### **Tired of pulling together slides for those upcoming board meetings? Don‚Äôt worry, we‚Äôve got you covered.**

Over the years, users have provided feedback or asked questions about best practices for creating a presentation of their strategic plan, which sparked an idea with our developers ‚Äì what if you could present your plan directly from MMC? Now it can be done using Presentation View!

Simply select Presentation View in the top tab navigation of your plan to get started.&nbsp;

### Timeline View

#### Thinking big and bold about your organization? Use the timeline to get a bird‚Äôs-eye view!

When Timeline View was rolled out, it allowed you to quickly see all of your goals within a specific time frame. We‚Äôve expanded this feature and it now includes action items. Filter the view by showing goals and action items assigned to you or see an organization-wide timeline.&nbsp;

### **START Lite**

**New to strategic planning? Review this free guide to get started!**

Mission Met‚Äôs&nbsp;[START course](https://www.missionmet.com/start){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;helps transform nonprofits by providing information about creating and implementing an actionable strategic plan and process. We‚Äôve adapted some of the information from that paid course and turned it into a free, slimmed-down version called START Lite. You can find it in&nbsp;[Toolbox](https://help.missionmet.com/articles/125-toolbox/){: target="_blank"}.

As a Mission Met Center user, you‚Äôll have lifelong access to START Lite, which gives you strategic planning guidance in the same software you use to document, measure, and update your strategic plan.&nbsp;

### **Activity Feed**

**Get the latest scoop****üç¶****&nbsp;on what your team is accomplishing!**

Your home screen now displays an activity feed. This area summarizes recent updates for your organization and beyond. You‚Äôll see a note when a goal or action item has been completed by someone on your team for your strategic plan. Global updates display how many goals and action items have been completed from all of MMC‚Äôs users. It also includes strategic planning news by linking to Mission Met‚Äôs recent blog posts.

### **Conference**

Some of Mission Met‚Äôs team will be presenting at the&nbsp;[NonprofIT SummIT](https://nonprofsummit.com/){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;in October, a month-long virtual conference that merges two topics we are always excited to talk about: nonprofits and technology. The conference is free, but there are some extra paid options if your team is interested.&nbsp;

Outside our sessions, there are many excellent speakers on topics ranging from fundraising and marketing to digital strategy and hardware/software upgrades.&nbsp;
