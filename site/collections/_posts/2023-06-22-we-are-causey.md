We've got some exciting news to share with you…

Mission Met Center has changed its name to Causey.

![](/uploads/causey-tagline.png){: width="4000" height="1090"}

## **Here’s the rest of the story…**

In the rest of this post, I'll answer some questions you may have:

* Why did we change names? And why Causey?
* What changes have been / are being made to the software?
* Will Causey be priced differently?
* When are these changes going into effect?

## **Why change names?**

Simplicity. As we’ve seen an increase in software customers, we recognize the need to better differentiate it from Mission Met’s consulting work. Changing the name of the product will help with that.

Over the last few years, we learned that our software product was just one part of Mission Met and we want to recognize that we are different from where we began. evolving into a much more capable software platform to power our mission-driven leaders and their teams.

…Which brings me to our new name :)

## **Introducing Causey**

After understanding why we needed a name change, we embarked on the hard part – choosing a name!&nbsp;

After a lot of work and reflection, we chose Causey for a few reasons.

First, I think it speaks to the essence of what you all do – working tirelessly for a cause. We’ve started saying our name is “cause with a y / why.” Sure, it helps with spelling, but it also has a deeper meaning to us. We must continue to keep focus on the cause for why we do what we do.&nbsp;

Did you know that “causey” is an abbreviated form of “causeway,” which is a raised way across wet ground or water? What a great visual interpretation of this strategic planning tool. Our software is a resource that helps you advance your strategic plan and gets you from one point to another. Just like a causeway.

Plus, we were able to get the domain, [causey.app](http://www.causey.app) ;)

# **How Causey builds on Mission Met Center**

In regards to the software, let us be clear:

* We have not rebuilt the product from scratch.
* Everything you can do with Mission Met Center today will continue in Causey.
* Mission Met is still here and encompasses our business. Causey is a product of Mission Met.

This vision for the product brings together all aspects of the strategic planning cycle we have spent a lifetime trialing and refining – leadership, assessments, planning, and executing. We also focus a lot of attention to develop features that advance aspects of a plan that are&nbsp; important to its success such as communicating, tracking, measuring. Here are a few highlights of features we’ve added or expanded since launching in 2015:

* New form redesign includes strategic planning guidance embedded in forms (example: suggestions based on common focus areas/goals)
* Ability to add notes, links, and attachments to goals (includes the ability to drag and drop these items in preferred order)
* Expanded translations for software includes Hindi, Maori, and English (UK and US)
* Ability to select the language and date/time format for a person receiving the plan via the view-only link
* Customize your plan by adding organization logo to plan, PDF outputs, and emails from software
* Add more than one action item owner
* Add metrics to focus areas and goals
* Presentation view
* Expanded timeline view now includes action items and allows for a user to filter by goals and items assigned to them or see all for organization
* START Lite added to Toolbox
* Activity feed
* Metric champions
* Expanded Metrics now includes baselines, delta/snapshot measurements
* Automated measurement reminder emails
* Ability to edit measurements instead of deleting and adding
* Export/import measurements and metrics
* If you missed it, check out the most recent [features announcement](https://www.causey.app/features/2023/04/25/mission-met-center-s-newest-features/)

So much of our vision is already in the product now and ready to put to use! We’re also excited to continue developing even more features for you. Our most recent features to introduce today are super focus mode and tagging.&nbsp;

We’ve expanded focus mode for core and solid tier subscribers. Focus mode for lite subscribers allows users to populate the actions of the plan for items that are only assigned to them. When super focus mode is on, users have the ability to populate the actions section by any person on your team, by tag (for solid subscriptions only) and by progress update status. Super focus mode is available in both the Strategy and Metrics apps.

Additionally, solid subscribers can create and add tags to most aspects of their plan. This makes your content easily searchable and can help you find information across your plan that relates to a specific topic.

## **Pricing**

In addition to our new name, we must also announce pricing changes coming into effect on August 31, 2023.

We reviewed our pricing strategy due to the growth of the product since launching.

We must continue to evolve to meet the needs of our customers and their strategic plans. Though we haven’t raised the price of the software since it launched in 2015, we recognize that the product has not and cannot stay stagnant and neither can our prices.

The tiered plans offer variety so you can pick the one that best fits your strategic planning needs for your team.&nbsp;

![](/uploads/causey-pricing-summary-1.png){: width="1280" height="800"}

Your organization will be automatically enrolled in the tier that best aligns with your current subscription and needs. If you’re a billing contact for your organization(s), you can switch your tier anytime before August 31, 2023.&nbsp;

You can use Causey for its standard rate until August 31. After that, you can always change your tier as it corresponds to your billing cycle (on a monthly or annual basis.)

Learn how to change your pricing tier [here](https://help.missionmet.com/articles/172-change-pricing-tier?auth=true&amp;preview=649353d8c371d73187fa3b95).

**As an existing customer, your plan will not change based on the limits of certain features in the new tiered pricing model**. You will retain all features as they are being used in your plan as of today. For example, the new pricing tiers cap organizations in the lite tier to 4 key metrics. If you are placed into the lite tier and have 10 key metrics, you will retain 10 metrics. We will not ask you to limit to 4, however, you will be not be able to add any additional metrics.
