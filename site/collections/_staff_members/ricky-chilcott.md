  As a passionate co-founder of Mission Met, a strategic planning company in
  Athens, Ohio, I combine my expertise in software development, business
  strategy, and project management to support non-profits globally. While my
  personal journey started with an almost decade long career in higher education,
  I'm so glad I'm in the social good sector.
