      Non-Exclusivity</strong></h3><ol><li><p>This Agreement does not create an
      exclusive agreement between You and Us. Both You and We will have the
      right to recommend similar products and services of third parties and to
      work with other parties in connection with the design, sale, installation,
      implementation, and use of similar services and products of third
      parties.</p></li></ol><h3><strong>Section 3: Partner
      Transactions</strong></h3><ol><li><p>Registered Leads. Once you have
      signed up as a Referral Partner, We will provide you with a unique
      referral link (“Link”) that links to a Mission Met website or Causey
      website to start the enrollment or sign up process. Whenever you tell a
      potential new Contact about Mission Met or Causey and how We can help
      improve their strategic execution, You or the potential new Contact will
      use that Link to sign up, enroll, or ask for a demonstration of our
      services or products, and attribute the Contact to your account. At this
      point, the Contact will be considered a Registered Lead, if the Contact
      passes the criteria outlined in “Eligibility” at the time We assess it.
      You must use the Link, otherwise, We have no way of tracking or knowing
      where the new Contact came from, and We will not associate the Contact
      with You or pay You a Revenue Share.</p></li><li><p>Eligibility. To
      qualify as a Registered lead, the Contact must pass all of the following
      criteria:</p><ol><li><p>The Contact is not currently a customer of Mission
      Met or Causey</p></li><li><p>The Contact is not currently a sales prospect
      of Mission Met or Causey</p></li><li><p>The registration of the Contact or
      selling to the Contact would not violate any other contracts that Mission
      Met or Causey holds.<br /><br />You are not eligible to receive a Revenue
      Share on any Refferer Transaction if: (i) such compensation is disallowed
      or limited by federal, state or local law or regulation in the United
      States or the laws or regulations of Your jurisdiction; (ii) the
      applicable End User objects to or prohibits the inclusion of such
      compensation in the price of the contract or excludes such compensation
      from its payments to Us; or (iii) the End User has paid or will pay such
      commissions, referral fees, or other compensation directly to You. We may
      discontinue Revenue Share payment should any of the eligibility criteria
      set forth in this subsection fail to be met at any time.<br /><br />If a
      Registered Lead does not purchase the Subscription Service within 120 days
      of becoming a Registered Lead, it will be considered expired and will
      revert to being considered a Contact. As such, You will need to complete
      the registration process again in order to re-qualify for a Revenue Share
      for that Contact. A Contact is not considered a valid Registered Lead: (i)
      if it is not registered, (ii) if it is expired, or (iii) if it is
      registered after this Agreement is expired or
      terminated.</p></li></ol></li><li><p>Promotion. You and Mission Met or
      Causey will cooperate in good faith to promote the Subscription Service.
      Each Link will permit recipients to navigate directly to a page on a
      Causey website designated by Us via a special tagged link
      format.</p></li></ol><h3><strong>Section 4: Revenue Share and
      Payment</strong></h3><ol><li><p>Tax and Bank Information. All Referral
      Partners are required to complete and submit proper tax information to
      Mission Met or Causey before commission payments will be issued.
      Additionally, you must provide us with the name and address of Your bank,
      Your account name and number, and the Swift (BIC) code, IBAN, and ACH
      number of Your account. This information will be requested from You via
      Our payment provider, Stripe.</p></li><li><p>Billing. You don’t have to
      worry about collecting any funds from any of the new Registered Leads you
      refer to Us. Mission Met or Causey will bill the End User directly and
      will be solely responsible for collecting payment. When a new End User
      subscribes to the Subscription Services through Your Link and begins a
      paid Subscription Service, You will be eligible for Revenue
      Share.</p></li><li><p>Revenue Share. The base Revenue Share for any
      Referral Partner is fifteen percent (15%) of revenue received from the
      initial charge from such End Users, then 15% of all additional revenue
      received from such subscribers after the first charge. This Revenue Share
      may be modified at Our sole discretion at the time of
      agreement.</p></li><li><p>Referral Partner Portal. As a Referral Partner,
      We will provide you with access to the Referral Program Dashboard using
      Your login credentials. There, you can see a summary report for all new
      subscriptions directed from Your Link for paid plans, including
      information on new subscriber pricing plans and the associated
      commissions.</p></li><li><p>Revenue Share Payment. When paying a
      commission, We, or one of Our affiliates, will pay the Revenue Share
      amount due to You within forty-five (45) days after the end of each fiscal
      quarter in an amount equal to the Net Revenue We recognize as revenue from
      Referral Transactions during such quarter, times the Revenue Share
      percentage. We will not pay more than one Revenue Share or other similar
      referral fee on any given referral sale (unless We choose to at our
      discretion), and We may apportion a Revenue Share if more than one of Our
      referral partners has contributed to the close of a sale. A balance of at
      least USD $50 must be accrued in Your account before you will receive a
      Revenue Share payment. Alternatively, at Your sole discretion, the Revenue
      Share Payment may be realized as a discount to the End User or
      You.</p></li><li><p>Taxes. You are responsible for payment of all taxes
      applicable to the Revenue Share. We will request tax forms (W-9 or W-8BEN,
      as applicable) and will report revenues to the United States Internal
      Revenue Service. We will not withhold taxes from
      payments.</p></li><li><p>True up. All amounts payable by Us to You are
      subject to offset by Us against any amounts owed by You to
      Us.</p></li><li><p>Change in Commission Rate. At Our discretion, We may
      increase referral commissions based on performance on a case-by-case basis
      and may revert back to the original percentage if performance does not
      remain consistent. We does not guarantee increases in commission to any
      affiliate, and We retain the right to change, modify, or cancel any
      commission plan at any time.<br /></p></li></ol><h3><strong>Section 5:
      Trademarks</strong></h3><ol><li><p>During the term of this Agreement, You
      may use Our trademark as You follow the usage requirements in this
