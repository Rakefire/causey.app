      <h2>Eligibility Criteria</h2><p>In order to be eligible, your organization
      must:</p><ul><li>Primarily serve a marginalized community.</li><li>Annual
      revenue below $1M USD.</li><li>Desire to implement and commitment to plan
      and execute strategically.</li><li>Willingness to share feedback and/or
      testimonials of success in the program.</li><li>Active 501c3 if US based,
      project of a fiscal-sponsored organization, or registered charity in

      customers are not eligible.</li></ul><p>To help you understand if your
      organization is eligible to apply, please review the below definition of a
      marginalized community.</p><p>A marginalized community consists of
      individuals and groups who are systematically disadvantaged due to a
      variety of factors that may include but are not limited to, race,
      ethnicity, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability status,
      socioeconomic status, geographic location, or religious affiliation.
      Marginalization can result from historical oppression, structural
      inequality, discrimination, and policies that perpetuate exclusion. These
      communities often have their voices silenced or overlooked in mainstream
      societal narratives and governance, leading to an exacerbation of
      disparities and barriers to opportunities.</p><p>Characteristics of
      Marginalized Communities:</p><ul><li><strong>Limited Access to Economic
      Opportunities</strong>: Marginalized communities often face higher rates
      of poverty, underemployment, and unemployment due to systemic barriers to
      education, training, and job markets.</li><li><strong>Reduced Access to
      Healthcare and Education</strong>: These communities may experience
      disparities in access to quality healthcare and education, influenced by
      factors such as geographic location, economic constraints, and systemic
      biases.</li><li><strong>Social Exclusion</strong>: Marginalized groups may
      be socially excluded or stigmatized based on their identity, beliefs, or
      status, affecting their social interactions and participation in community
      life.</li><li><strong>Political Disempowerment</strong>: They often have
      limited representation and voice in political processes and governance,
      impacting their ability to influence decisions that affect their
      lives.</li><li><strong>Vulnerability to Violence and
      Discrimination</strong>: Marginalization can increase susceptibility to
      various forms of violence, abuse, and discrimination, further entrenching
      inequalities.</li></ul><p>If the population that you primarily serve fall
      into any one of these categories, then you serve a marginalized
      community.</p>
