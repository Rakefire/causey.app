Eligibility Criteria</h2><p>Your nonprofit organization is eligible if it serves marginalized communities.</p><p>To help you understand if your organization is eligible to apply, please review the below definition of a marginalized community.</p><p>A marginalized community consists of individuals and groups who are systematically disadvantaged due to a variety of factors that may include but are not limited to, race, ethnicity, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability status, socioeconomic status, geographic location, or religious affiliation. Marginalization can result from historical oppression, structural inequality, discrimination, and policies that perpetuate exclusion. These communities often have their voices silenced or overlooked in mainstream societal narratives and governance, leading to an exacerbation of disparities and barriers to opportunities.</p><p>Characteristics of Marginalized Communities:</p><ul><li><strong>Limited Access to Economic Opportunities</strong>: Marginalized communities often face higher rates of poverty, underemployment, and unemployment due to systemic barriers to education, training, and job markets.</li><li><strong>Reduced Access to Healthcare and Education</strong>: These communities may experience disparities in access to quality healthcare and education, influenced by factors such as geographic location, economic constraints, and systemic biases.</li><li><strong>Social Exclusion</strong>: Marginalized groups may be socially excluded or stigmatized based on their identity, beliefs, or status, affecting their social interactions and participation in community life.</li><li><strong>Political Disempowerment</strong>: They often have limited representation and voice in political processes and governance, impacting their ability to influence decisions that affect their lives.</li><li><strong>Vulnerability to Violence and Discrimination</strong>: Marginalization can increase susceptibility to various forms of violence, abuse, and discrimination, further entrenching inequalities.</li></ul><p>If the population that you primarily serve fall into any one of these categories, then you serve a marginalized community.</p><h2>4. Application Process</h2><p>Apply by April 8. Applications will be reviewed in April and selected organizations will be notified in May.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc404T42qo3qEjwDWCeMUu6XXVbYHQWnw7KDQM8tTW9bdM5Nw/viewform\">Access the Application</a></p><p>For support or questions about the application process, please email <a href=\"mailto:help@causey.app?subject=Support%20for%20Marginalized%20Communities%20Application\">help@causey.app</a>.</p>"
